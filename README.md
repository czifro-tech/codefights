Submitted Solutions to CodeFights

These are my solutions to various codefights problems, including solutions that passed all test cases, but failed due to time constraint on hidden cases. All solutions will be in F# unless for some reason F# does not run for a certain problem, usually an issue with CodeFights' execution of F#.

To run requires `dotnet core preview5+`.

Simply:

- `dotnet restore`
- `dotnet build`
- `dotnet run`

There is a very simply CLI to choose which module, i.e. interview practice, bot challenges, etc., and from those modules, choose a specific problem. Some problems may offer multiple solutions to choose from. The console output is simply the inputs used, the expected result, and the actual result for each case.
