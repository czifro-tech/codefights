# coding-challenges

This project contains coding solutions to challenges from various sources, i.e. codefights, interview challenges, etc. Solutions are primarily written in F#. Each solution is executable with predefined input. To provide flexibility to the system, each solution is presented as a microservice and interacted with using an API gateway. This doubles as an opportunity for me to experiment with technology for supporting microservices.
